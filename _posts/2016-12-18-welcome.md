We are a hobby farm exploring Joel Salatin's pastured poultry techniques with ducks and geese.

## 2017 Plans

* New duck flock in 7'x8' mobile pen for egg production
* Broiler chicken and home slaughter trials
* Use geese for lawn rejuvenation

## History

* 2016:  Heavy Predator Losses, First Portable Pen
  * Current flock 2 Metzer White Layer ducks, 1 Pekin duck, 4 Toulouse geese
  * 6 out of 9 laying ducks lost over three days to predators in traditional pens
  * Geese spent summer in 8'x10' covered pen moved its length each day.  Geese loved it.  Grass loved it.
  * 3 out of 12 laying ducks lost to racoons
  * Egg sales exceeded feed costs
  * Geese hatched three eggs and two survived
* 2014:  Flock Rebuild, Raising Ducks for Meat, Raising Geese
  * Excess Rouen hens added to layer flock
  * Independent USDA Poultry processor closed doors.  Further meat attempts will be home slaughter
  * Two batches Pekins and One batch Rouens raised and processed.  Did not account for processing fees in pricing
  * 9 Metzer White Layer hens, 1 Metzer White Layer drake join the remaining layer flock
* 2006: Initial Flock
  * Mallard hen flies off and never returns
  * Mallards discover flying
  * Rescue two mallards
  * Rescue three Pekins
  * Welsh Harlequin and Chocolate Runner for initial flock
