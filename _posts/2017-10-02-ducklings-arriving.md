We lost our duck flock to predators around March.  We intended to restart our new flock with a September 11th hatching.  Hurricane Irma delayed that date to an October 2nd hatching.  Silver Appleyard Ducklings are enroute.  Alas, Metzer farms is having hatcing problems on their endangered breeds and they were only able to ship 17 birds out of an order of 25.  We've starting a [breeding program](/projects/2018-breeding/) to help address these problems.

To prepare for the ducklings we tore down the packing crate based shelters and replaced with a "portable garage."  This was less labor than the prior duck houses.  This was also less expensive than our first duck house.

To utilize the capital investment, we're planning broiler chickens as soon as ducklings are in their portable pen.  We'll try multiple hatcheries and provide details as we have them.  We intend to offer slaughter at home classes as we gain proficiency.
