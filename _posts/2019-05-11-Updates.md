## New Geese

We hatched two Toulouse geese summer of 2018.  We're saddened one developed [angel wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_wing) and the other shows the foot deformity of a niacin deficiency.  These geese have been integrated with their parents and are now tooling around the front yard in their portable pen.

## New Ducks

We lost most of our incubated duck eggs to structural failure on the egg turner.  Five survived adding two hens and three drakes.  We offer the three drakes for $25 each.

## New Pens

In early 2018 we built a 6'x8' portable pen for the ducks and they saw every patch of grass in the back yard before heading off to our side yard.
We kept it light by
* Used aluminum coil for roof and windbreak sides
* Used 2x4s ripped to 2x2s for side frames
* Used lath for the roof frames
* Minimal cross bracing
* Strategic screws in frame for pull ropes
* Did not have plans on automatic founts

October of 2018 we built an 8'x12' portable pen.
* Used 1x2 pressure treated for roof frame instead of lath
* Planned for a [Little Giant Automatic Fount](https://www.strombergschickens.com/product/Little-Giant-Automatic-Fount-Universal/Automatic-Founts)

The new and old ducks were consolidated in the new pen after a week of having both pens close to each other.  And they have almost traveled the entire side yard.

After the geese began their 2019 laying season and the rains created a river across their pen the roof of the 6x8 pen was rebuilt and retrofitted with an automatic fount.  The geese were relocated about a week ahead of the ducks in the side yard.

## New Interest

May 1st the geese finished mowing the side yard and were moved to the front yard.  And May 6th or 7th someone stopped thinking the ducks were in danger (They were not despite Calyx surveyors stopping next to them).  And on May 9th folks stopped ready to rescue poultry they were sure fell off a truck and bring it to a pond.  So signs were made.
