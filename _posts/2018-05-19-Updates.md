Our first incubated goslings hatched May 1st and 2nd.  Ducks began laying March 22nd and reaching 4-6 eggs/day April 21st.

The winter was rough.  We lost two Silver Appleyard hens despite several heat lamps and shelter.  We lost one goose.  Our goose (one goose, two ganders) began laying in February.  And produced 52 eggs so far this year with no supplemental light.  We expect 25-30 for the Toulouse breed.

Ducks were moved from the portable garage to the portable pen the Saturday before they began hatching.  They're using a 5 gallon drinker, a section of gutter as a feed trough, a bit of stoneware as an oyster shell container, and a bucket for weekly bathing.  And they're clean, healthy, and destroying the weeds in the back yard while producing 6 eggs a day most days.

We acquired a styrofoam incubator with large egg turner and almost recouped our capital investment with the first hatching.  Seven of seven eggs show they'd set after the first week.  Six of seven eggs showed embryo development after the second week.  Six of the six eggs began pipping.  Four of the six eggs were able to pip out.  The goslings dried out after a couple days and enjoyed having a drinker with electrolytes and probiotics in addition to the water drinker.  They also began vocational training to eat broadleaf weeds.
