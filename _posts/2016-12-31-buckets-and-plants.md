# Buckets

Waterfowl love a right sized bucket of water.
Ducks and geese need sufficient water to blow water through their nostrils.
Provide enough for them to dunk their heads and they're overjoyed.
During the summer, I'd used mortar mixing tubs for their deep water needs.
Winter's random freezes brough a stop to that.
But they're happy again.
The geese have a kitty litter bucket.
The ducks have a gallon pail.

The waterfowl are happy and clean.  The two ducks from 2014 are producing one to two eggs a day.

# Cardboard

In theory, four or more birds and share one nest.
In practice, I'm finding the soil of too many broken eggs.
We'll see if another nesting box made out of a bulk box of backup tapes 
does the trick.

Cardboard lasts longer under duck behavior than I expected.  The headache, 
the box top flaps would flop over when I tried to use them to increase 
the height.  Packing tape would unstick.  Straight staples would come undone.
Using a desk stapler to attach cardboard bracing on the inside, with the
curled part of the staple to the outside works wonders.  And a light touch of packing tape on the outside covers any sharp bits.

# Plants

It's been a busy day transplanting and starting new plants.

Of eight collected camelia seeds, three germinated, one rotted.  The three germinated
camelias have their own pots now.  They were started in moist vermiculite
in a clear plastic cup with lid back in October.

Twenty one or more hostas have been transferred to seven condiment cups.
They were started in the fall in moist vermiculite in a clear plastic cup with
lid.  Some were transferred to clear plastic cups with potting soil and tucked
away in a brick flower bed next to the house when the hard frosts started.
We have a few that are still green outside.

Two trays prepped for hosta seed germination.  
* Holes punched into the bottoms of two plastic food trays
* A layer of vermiculite added to each try
* A layer of hosta seeds added
* Another vermiculite layer
* Soaked vermiculite from bottom until moist on top.
* Drained
* Placed in gallon plastic bags
