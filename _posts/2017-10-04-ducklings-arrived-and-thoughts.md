Ducklings arrived, the call came at 11:42 AM which is the latest to date.

They are all settled.
## Firsts
* Vitamin and probiotic supplements to their first water
* Ohio brooder
* A brooder house I can move in comfortably

They're enjoying the space and the ability to move around and they can see all of the big thing reaching for them.

## Things we got right
* Ohio brooder.  Seventeen biological thermostats are a wonder to behold.
* Plywood ring around two thirds of the portable garage "floor".  No drafts.  Easy with litter.  Predator proof on three sides.
* Keeping the heatlamps, feeders, drinkers, supplements, feed, and litter in the structure.
* Large area with litter that can be entered standing upright

## Tweaks for next time
* Ohio brooder wattage and sizing.
  * 225 watts in 2'x2' seems to be too much on an 85F day
  * 12 inches tall plywood on the sides had the top too close to the heat lamp and melted mylar
  * Need to log temperature under brooder, within structure, and outside structure with wind speed
* Have shelves/platforms for storing equipment and consumables high enough for birds to go under and to ease wear and tear on my back
* Plywood around entire interior
  * Have entire space available and easy to subdivide with cardboard
  * Make sure the zippered entrance is predator proof
* Hanging waterers fed from a bucket or tank
  * Easier to adjust height to keep feces out of the water and lower liver strain on birds
  * Easier to provide supplements to multiple groups of birds
  * Easier to refill
  * Refills not needed as often
* Hanging bulk feeders
  * Easier to adjust height to keep feces out of feed and lower liver strain on birds
  * Easier to refill and fewer refills needed
* Better power cord organization
  * Need trip free path to individual brooders or heat lamps
* Instructions to fill out order with another bird that appears different
* Soak locations for anchors ahead of time
* Attach base of portable garage to 2x4s with merchant wire cross bracing
  * A rigid structure will be easier to move
  * Easier to square structure
  * Easier to know where to soak ground for anchors
