# Bullet Journal

Farm activities and plans are tracked in a 
[bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/get-started/). 
As the journal stays at home or in the truck, a cheap graph paper
composition book works fine.

### Tweaks

* Monthly Inventory.
* Monthly Ledger.  Three Column is helpful.
* E- tags noting egg records
* F- tags noting feed records

# Brooder Plans
