Our original Toulouse goose decided Spring began in January.
She began laying eggs about two weeks ago and we have six eggs in the large duck house.  We're hoping this weeks cold nights won't cause any problems and she'll have a successful brood once she sets.

Hostas began germinating last weekend and most have a single proud leaf.  We'll start transplanting as soon as we see two or more leaves.

And a tool.  With our low egg production it helps to have a marker for each day's eggs.  [egg_dates.py](/snippets/egg_dates.py) helps.  I plan to rewrite using pdfkit for a static content interactive generator.
