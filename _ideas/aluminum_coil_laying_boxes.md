had considered 5 gallon buckets for laying boxes.  But these are too small for geese.
Had been thinking how to use a larger plastic barrel.  But then it hit me, 2' wide aluminum coil is about the same dimensions as the plywood boxes.
6.28-8' of coil per laying box.  Use cardboard as a back as only needs to last for goose laying season.

Will need to do trials for assembly time and cost per box.
