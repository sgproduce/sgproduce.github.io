# Concept
Trying to capture Joel Salatin's idea into a reproducable fashion.

We have a first prototype built here.
(Insert image link to current poultry tractor)

## Problems:

* Too heavy due to rough 2x4 materials
* Tarp for rain cover/windbreak not reliable
* too fiddly on top panel configuration
* Note suited for quick assembly on site.

## Ideas:

front and side panels prepped with chicken wire or aluminum coil and 
ends suitable for immediate fastening.
Right now my gut tells me to have the ends of the side panels exposed at the front and back.
