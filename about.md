We are a hobby farm exploring Joel Salatin's pastured poultry techniques with ducks and geese.

Our current flock:
* Three Toulouse geese
* Four Toulouse goslings
* Six Toulouse goose eggs in the incubator, expect June 12th hatching
* Eight Silver Appleyard ducks (six hens, two drakes)

We offer fresh duck eggs for $7/dozen.  We collect eggs each morning and immediately refrigerate.

We offer fresh goose eggs in season for $2 each or three for $5.

Reserve a Thanksgiving or Christmas goose for $12.
