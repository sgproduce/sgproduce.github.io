We're trying to grow a rain garden with [Sorghum x drummondii (Sudangrass)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum_%C3%97_drummondii) because we have areas where heavy rain flows over our patches of clay towards our house.  Growing a deep rooted grass is less energy intensive than digging high catch basins to slow the water.
