# Project Grass
## Or How I Delay Mowing The Lawn

Yes, the grass is tall because we are letting it go to seed.  Because we want grass that will stay green in our summers, our winters, and reseed without additional water.  We see several genera of grass from the original fescue lawn, the invading common bermuda grass, the sprigged zoysia, and various grasses coming from the pasture.

We mow as soon as most seed heads have ripened and dropped seeds.
